=== Common info

This service implements handlers for Telegram bor for easy stickers creation.
The main platform for this service is Telegram, because it`s an easiest way to provide UI for interaction.
Maybe one time there will be a webpage or API, but not in near future.

Currently, the core features are:
* Remove picture background(it`s not perfect, so keep it in mind);
* Crop empty space;
* Resize image to sticker size(at least one side should be 512px);
* Add top and bottom text(in case of adding top text 15% top padding will be added as well);

Basically the result is something like this:

[cols="a,a", frame=none, role="center"]

=== Local run

To run service you ought to have Docker

Just run the command:
`docker-compose up`
(uncomment service container if you want it fully containerized)

Or you can run service locally(with `local` profile) and try it through rest api
